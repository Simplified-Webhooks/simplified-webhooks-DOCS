### Setup the Make Scenario

Create a new scenario, search for 'Simplified Webhooks' and choose the `Watch Deleted Airtable Records` module. If you have not setup a module before, visit the [quickstart](https://docs.simplified-webhooks.com/quickstart) to go through every step.

### Receiving Triggers

The module `Watch Deleted Airtable Records` receives a trigger every time a record has been deleted in the chosen **Table** of your Airtable Base.

The output of the module will always look like this:

```json expandable
{
        "id": "90b26bea-80d2-404f-96e0-0d685fe3061d",
        "event": "delete",
        "recordId": "rec4yurm8f16BwMFj",
        "tableId": "tblKn2Ygplrq5Kmbg",
        "baseId": "appatVcKk6xNFwPej",
        "meta": {
            "source": "client",
            "occurredAt": "2025-07-14T08:47:20.174Z",
            "user": {
                "id": "usrnwwJUfsBR6EMXl",
                "name": "Test User",
                "email": "test.user@gmail.com"
            }
        }
    }
```

### Key components

In every delete-trigger you will always find

```json
{
"event":"delete",
"recordId":"",
"tableId":"",
"baseId":"",
"meta":{}
}
```

This helps to know **what has happened** and **where in your Airtable Base**.

### When to use the "Watch Deleted Airtable Records" module

Using the Simplified Webhooks module **is the only way to trigger Make Scenarios for deleted** **Airtable Records**. Watching deleted records usually comes up when you would like to prevent deletion but because of the interface or base settings you cannot clearly forbid it.

With the new trigger you **notify your team members who deleted** the records. You can **restore the deleted records** _manually_ or even setup a process to _automatically_ restore those records.

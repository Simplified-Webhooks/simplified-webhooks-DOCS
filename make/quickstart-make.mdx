  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your Airtable account">
    You'll need to create a Personal Access Token in Airtable to allow Simplified Webhooks to monitor your bases.

    <Accordion title="How to create a Personal Access Token (PAT)">
      You can create a Personal Access Token in your Airtable account settings. For detailed instructions, refer to the [official Airtable documentation.](https://support.airtable.com/docs/creating-personal-access-tokens)

      Make sure to grant the following scopes:

      ```typescriptreact
      schema.bases:read
      webhook:manage
      data.records:read
      ```

      We've also prepared a short video to walk you through the process:

  <Step title="Create a Simplified Webhooks API Key">
    The API Key is used to create a connection between Make and your Simplified Webhooks account. You can create an API key in your [profile settings](https://www.simplified-webhooks.com/profile-settings).

    <Note>
      **Important:** We only show the API Key once. Treat your API Key like a password. Store it in a safe place and do not share it. You can always revoke your API Key and create a new one.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup your trigger in Make">
    1. Create a new scenario and search for **Simplified Webhooks** in the list of apps.
    2. Select the trigger you need (`New Records`, `Updated Records`, `Deleted Records`)
    3. If you setup a trigger for the first time, Make will prompt you to create a new connection. Give it a name and paste the **API Key** your created in the previous step.
    4. Once the connection is active, simply select the Airtable **Base** and **Table** from the dropdown menus and you are done\!
  </Step>
  <Step title="You're done!" icon="party-horn">
    Your Make scenario will now run instantly whenever a record is changed in your selected Airtable base.

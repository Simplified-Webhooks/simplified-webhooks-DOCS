## What is Simplified Webhooks?

Simplified Webhooks replaces slow, polling-based Airtable triggers with **instant webhooks**. This means your automations run in **seconds, not minutes**, after a record is created, updated, or deleted.

Our integration apps **handle all the complexity for you**. You simply connect your accounts and we set up the instant connection to Airtable automatically.

## Let's get started

Setup your first webhooks in minutes.

### When to use Simplified Webhhoks

In many cases you can use Airtable automations to send a request to your webhook. If **speed matters** or **you need to know who changed** something, the Simplified Webhooks modules will be your friend.
